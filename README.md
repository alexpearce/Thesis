Thesis
======

This is the repository for my PhD thesis, based on the [thesis 
template](https://github.com/alexpearce/thesistemplate).

I'm not sure if Ill push update here, in public, as I go along, so stay tuned 
for more exciting news!
Or not, as the case may be.

In addition to a relatively recent LaTeX installation, such as [TeX 
Live][texlive] 2015, compiling the document requires the 
[tikz-feynman][tikz-feynman] package.
