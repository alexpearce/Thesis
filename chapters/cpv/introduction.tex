\label{chap:cpv:introduction}

The breaking of the combined charge-parity~(\CP) symmetry in weak interactions, 
as well as the definition \CP\ transformation, has been discussed in 
\cref{chap:intro:sm}.
\CP\ violation is necessary to generate the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the 
universe, and in particular the process of baryogenesis which created the 
imbalance between baryons and anti-baryons.
The experimental study of \CP\ asymmetries is then intimately connected to a 
wider understanding of nature.

Only interactions of the weak force have been observed to violate \CP\ 
symmetry.
The strong force, while not theoretically invariant under the \CP 
transformation, has not been experimentally observed to violate \CP\@.
Electromagnetism, the remaining force described by the \acl{SM}, is invariant 
in its theoretical definition.
However, the magnitude of the asymmetry produced by \ac{SM} processes is not 
large enough to account for the origins of the universe, and so additional 
sources of \CP\ violation must exist.
