\chapter{Results}

The difference in the raw asymmetries of the \pKK\ and \ppipi\ data defines 
\dACP
\begin{equation*}
  \dACP = \ARaw(\pKK) - \ARaw(\ppipi).
\end{equation*}
The values of and uncertainties on \ARaw\ are measured by the weighted fits 
described in \cref{chap:cpv:araw}.
In this section, the combinations of \ARaw\ are made within and across the 
data-taking years (2011 and 2012) and magnet polarities (magnet up and down), 
and the measured values of \ARaw\ and \dACP\ are reported.

\section{Combining measurements}
\label{chap:cpv:results:combination}

The values of \ARaw\ for a given year and polarity are measured in the fits.
Within a given year $\zeta$, $\zeta \in [2011, 2012]$, the average value of the 
\ARaw\ is defined as the arithmetic mean of the two values of \ARaw\ measured 
on the magnet up and magnet down data
\begin{equation}
  \ARaw(\zeta) = \frac{%
    \ARaw{}^{\uparrow} + \ARaw{}^{\downarrow}
  }{%
    2
  }.
  \label{eqn:cpv:results:araw_year}
\end{equation}
This quantity is defined for both $\ARaw(\pKK)$ and $\ARaw(\ppipi)$.
The average value of \dACP\ within a year is then defined using the results of 
\cref{eqn:cpv:results:araw_year}
\begin{equation}
  \dACP(\zeta) = \ARaw(\zeta, \pKK) - \ARaw(\zeta, \ppipi).
\end{equation}
Across both years, the values of \ARaw\ are computed as the weighted sum of the 
per-year values, where the weights are the inverses of the squares of the 
statistical uncertainties $\sigma$ on the measurements
\begin{equation}
  \ARaw =
    \frac{1}{\frac{1}{\sigma_{2011}^{2}} + \frac{1}{\sigma_{2012}^{2}}}
    \left(
      \frac{1}{\frac{1}{\sigma_{2011}^{2}}}\ARaw(2011) +
      \frac{1}{\frac{1}{\sigma_{2012}^{2}}}\ARaw(2012)
    \right)
  \label{eqn:cpv:results:araw_polarity}
\end{equation}
Note that this quantity can be computed using the polarity-average \ARaw\ 
measurements, defined in \cref{eqn:cpv:results:araw_year}, and it can also be 
computed per polarity, for example to compute the average magnet down result 
across 2011 and 2012.

The measured values of $\ARaw(\pKK)$, $\ARaw(\ppipi)$, and \dACP\ are given in 
\cref{tab:cpv:results:asymmetries}.
Plots of the three measurements for each data sub-sample are given in 
\cref{fig:cpv:results:asymmetries}, where a \chisq\ fit of a constant function 
to the measurements is also shown.
The value of \dACP\ averaged across all magnet polarities and years, as 
computed with \cref{eqn:cpv:results:araw_year,eqn:cpv:results:araw_polarity}, 
is measured as
\begin{equation*}
  \dACP = \deltaACP.
  \label{eqn:cpv:results:dacp}
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Unweighted asymmetries}

The results computed without the inclusion of the kinematic weights are given 
in \cref{tab:cpv:results:asymmetries_unweighted}.
The average value of \dACP\ in these results is measured as
\begin{equation*}
  \dACP = \deltaACPUnweighted.
\end{equation*}
The central value does not change with respect to the weighted measurement.
Assuming the weighting does correctly equalise the kinematic, this indicates 
that the differences between the modes were small before the weighting.
The \SI{3}{\percent} reduction in the statistical uncertainty is due to the 
effective increase in the \ppipi\ sample size when unweighted, and illustrates 
that the uncertainty is dominated by the \pKK\ sample size.
