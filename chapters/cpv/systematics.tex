\chapter{Systematic uncertainties}
\label{chap:cpv:syst}

The measurement of \dACP\ in \cref{chap:cpv:results} carries a statistical 
uncertainty due to finite \pKK\ and \ppipi\ sample sizes.
Three sources of systematic uncertainty are considered in this analysis: the 
arbitrary choice of model used to extract the \PLambdac\ and \APLambdac\ signal 
yields; the failure of the kinematic weighting procedure to fully equalise the 
\PLambdab, \Pmuon, and \Pproton kinematics between the modes; and the accuracy 
of the efficiency model derived from the \ac{MC} data.
The effect of these on the measurement of \dACP\ will be discussed in this 
\namecref{chap:cpv:syst} and, where appropriate, systematic uncertainties will 
be computed.
