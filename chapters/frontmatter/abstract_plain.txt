This thesis presents two measurements made using data collected by the LHCb
detector, operating at the Large Hadron Collider accelerator at the CERN particle physics
laboratory.
The first is a measurement of the production rates of promptly produced
D0, D+, Ds+, and D*+ open charm mesons, using data
collected in 2015 at a proton-proton centre-of-mass energy of sqrt(s) = 13 TeV.
The second is a search for direct CP violation in two three-body decays of
the Lambda_c charm baryon, pKK and ppipi, using data collected in 2011 at
sqrt(s) = 7 TeV and in 2012 at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV.
For each measurement, motivation and context are given from the standpoint of
improving the theoretical understanding of the Standard Model and searching for signs
of physics that cannot be explained by it, and then the various statistical
analysis techniques used to extract physical quantities from the data are
explained.
The systematic limitations of the method are explored and quantified, and then
the results are presented.
