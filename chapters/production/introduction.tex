\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:prod:introduction}

The measurement of cross-sections is one of the more fundamental measurements a 
particle physics experiment can make.
This \namecref{chap:prod} describes a measurement of prompt open charm and 
\ccbar\ production measured with the \lhcb\ detector using data taken at 
$\sqrts = \SI{13}{\TeV}$.
`Open charm' refers to particles whose charm quantum number is non-zero, as 
opposed to charmonium states, such as \PJpsi, which contain charm quarks but 
whose charm quantum number is zero.
`Prompt' refers to charm hadrons that are produced directly in the 
proton-proton interaction, rather than `secondary' hadrons which are produced 
in the decays of \PB hadrons.

Measurements of \ccbar\ and \bbbar\ cross-sections at the \ac{LHC} test the 
predictions of \ac{QCD}.
The production rate of \ccbar\ and \bbbar\ quark pairs is expected to vary as a 
function of \pT\ and rapidity \rapidity, defined as
\begin{equation}
  y = \frac{1}{2}\ln{\frac{E + p_{z}}{E - p_{z}}},
  \label{eqn:prod:introduction:rapidity}
\end{equation}
and so experimental measurements can be compared with both the shape of 
theoretical predictions as a function of \pTy, as well as to the total 
integrated rate.
They can also be used as inputs to future predictions as constraints.
Heavy flavour production rates are also used as inputs to experimental searches 
for rare decays, where, when combined with the luminosity, they provide an 
estimate for the total number of parent particles were produced in the detector 
acceptance, and as inputs to atmospheric neutrino experiments, where charm 
production enters as a background process.

Measuring \ccbar\ and \bbbar\ cross-sections at \lhcb\ is complementary to such 
measurements by the \ac{GPD}, due to the unique rapidity range it instruments, 
as well as its ability to cleanly reconstruct low \pT\ hadrons.

\section{Analysis overview}
\label{chap:prod:introduction:analysis_overview}

The cross-section for an open charm hadron \PHc\ is expressed as
\begin{equation}
  \xsec_{i}(\PHc) = \frac{%
    N_{i}(\HcTof)
  }{%
    \eff_{i}(\HcTof)\cdot\bfrac(\HcTof)\cdot\intlumi
  },
  \label{eqn:prod:introduction:cross_section}
\end{equation}
where the numerator is the measured yield of promptly produced decays of \PHc\ 
to some final state $f$, and the denominator consists of: the efficiency that 
the decay \HcTof\ is fully reconstructed and selected, given that is was 
produced; the branching fraction \bfrac\ of the decay; and integrated 
% TODO integrated luminosity should be defined
luminosity \intlumi\ corresponding to the dataset used for the measurement.
To compare with the shapes of theoretical predictions, double differential 
cross sections can then be determined in \pTy\ bins using the width $\Delta\pT$ 
of the bin in \pT and the width $\Delta\rapidity$ of the bin in rapidity in 
which the yield and efficiency measurements were made
\begin{equation}
  % There is a "\left." here, which is invisible, to balance the "\right\rvert"
  \left.\frac{\text{d}^{2}\xsec(\PHc)}{\text{d}\pT\text{d}\rapidity}\right\rvert_{i}
    = \frac{\xsec_{i}(\PHc)}{\Delta\pT\Delta\rapidity}.
  \label{eqn:prod:introduction:differential_cross_section}
\end{equation}

This analysis measures the double differential cross-sections of \PDzero, \PDp, 
\PDsplus, and \PDstarp.
Charge conjugation is implied, in that the cross-sections measure the combined 
rate of meson and anti-meson production.
The measurements are made in the \pT\ range $0 < \pT < \SI{15}{\GeV}$ and the 
rapidity range $2 < \rapidity < 4.5$.
In \rapidity, the measurements are made in five bins of width 0.5, and in \pT\ 
the bins are \SI{1}{\GeV} in width in the regions $0 < \pT < \SI{1}{\GeV}$ and 
$4 < \pT < \SI{15}{\GeV}$, and are \SI{0.5}{\GeV} in width in the region $1 < 
\pT < \SI{4}{\GeV}$.

From the double differential measurements, several derived quantities are 
computed, namely the ratio of charm production rates measured at $\sqrts = 
\SI{13}{\TeV}$ and those measured by \lhcb\ at \SI{7}{\TeV}, open charm hadron 
cross-sections integrated across the \pTy\ space, and integrated \ccbar\ 
cross-sections.
Each integrated per-meson cross-section is the sum over all \pTy\ bins of the 
respective double differential measurements
\begin{equation}
  \xsec{(\PHc)} =
    \sum_{i}^{N} \xsec_{i}(\PHc).
  \label{eqn:prod:introduction:integrated_cross_section}
\end{equation}
The total \ccbar cross-sections can be computed using \emph{fragmentation 
  fractions}; each a measurement of the transition probability that a charm 
quark will hadronise to a particular open charm hadron $f(\cToHc)$.
Given the fragmentation fraction, and the integrated cross-section defined in 
\cref{eqn:prod:introduction:integrated_cross_section}, the integrated \ccbar\ 
cross-section can be computed as
\begin{equation}
  \xsec{(\ccbar)} = \frac{\xsec(\PHc + \APHc)}{2f(\cToHc)}.
  \label{eqn:prod:introduction:ccbar_cross_section}
\end{equation}
The factor \sfrac{1}{2} arises from the fragmentation fraction not accounting 
for charge conjugate states, which have been noted explicitly here in the 
expression for the measured cross-section to avoid ambiguity.
For this analysis, the fragmentation fractions are taken from the 
\ac{PDG}~\cite{PDG2008}, who compute them as averages of measurements made at 
$\Pelectron\APelectron$ colliders operating at a \sqrts\ close to the 
\PUpsilonFourS resonance.
These values are given in \cref{tab:prod:introduction:fragmentation_fractions}, 
where the transition probability for \PDzero, $f(\decay{\Pcharm}{\PDzero})$, 
includes contributions from \DstToDzpi\ decays.

The data used for the measurements was collected in July 2016, under a set of 
special conditions used for the restart of the \ac{LHC} after \ac{LS1}.
The conditions of the \ac{LHC} and of the \lhcb\ detector will be described in 
\cref{chap:prod:data}, along with a summary of the integrated luminosity 
measurement.
The data are then reconstructed and selected to build charm hadron candidates, 
which will be presented in \cref{chap:prod:sel}.
The evaluation of the associated efficiencies is performed using a mixture of 
simulated \acl{MC} data and dedicated calibration samples, and is discussed in 
\cref{chap:prod:effs}.
The extraction of the prompt yields is made on the fully reconstructed and 
selected data using the method of maximum likelihood fits, as described in 
\cref{chap:prod:fitting}, after which the systematic uncertainties associated 
with all procedures used in the measurement are evaluated, for which the 
description and results are given in \cref{chap:prod:systs}.
Finally, the measurements themselves are computed, and are presented in 
\cref{chap:prod:results}.

Before the discussion on the experimental methods and the results, further 
motivation for performing measurements heavy flavour cross-sections, both 
theoretical and experimental, will be presented in the following 
\namecref{chap:prod:theory}.

% Measurements of \ccbar and \bbbar cross sections test the predictions of 
% \ac{QCD}, and as the rapidity range available to \lhcb is unique at the 
% \ac{LHC}, such measurements are complementary to those made by other 
% experiments.
% In addition, charm cross section measurements are used as inputs to background 
% estimations in atmospheric neutrino experiments~\cite{Bhattacharya:2015jpa}, 
% and to determine the parton distribution functions~\cite{Zenaiev:2015rfa}.

% This analysis note documents the efforts to measure the double differential 
% cross sections of various promptly produced open charm hadrons at a 
% centre-of-mass energy of \comenergy.
% The cross section is measured in bins of charm hadron transverse momentum $\pT 
% = \sqrt{p_{x}^{2} + p_{y}^{2}}$ and rapidity $\rapidity = 1/2\ln{(E + p_{z})/(E 
% - p_{z})}$, as computed in the rest frame of the proton-proton collision.

% A measurement of prompt open charm cross sections has been made using a dataset 
% corresponding to an integrated luminosity of \SI{15.0(5)}{\per\nano\barn} 
% collected in 2010 at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrts = 
% \SI{7}{\TeV}$~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2012-041}, and also at \SI{13}{\TeV} with 
% \SI{4.98(19)}{\per\micro\barn} of integrated luminosity collected in 
% 2015~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2015-041}.
% This analysis follows a near-identical methodology to the latter, which is 
% thoroughly documented in the corresponding analysis 
% note~\cite{LHCb-ANA-2015-023}.

% The open charm hadrons used for this measurement are \Dz, \Dp, \Dsp, and \Dstp.
% These are reconstructed in the following final states: \DzToKpi, \DpToKpipi, 
% \DspTophipi, and \DstToDzpi with \DzToKpi.
% Unless otherwise stated, the addition of the charge conjugate process is 
% implied throughout this note.

% As charm hadrons can be produced both promptly from the \pp collision and in 
% the decays of \B hadrons, we statistically separate the two contributions 
% through extended maximum likelihood fits to the charm hadron \ipchisq 
% distribution in order to measure the prompt yields.
% Aside from the explicit measurement of the \Dstp production cross-section,
% no attempt is made to distinguish prompt hadrons produced from prompt excited 
% charm resonances from those produced directly in the \pp collision.

% \subsection{Analysis overview}
% \label{sec:intro:overview}

% The analysis will reconstruct and select the various charm decays, measure the 
% size of the prompt signal component $N$, and then compute the efficiency \eff 
% of each step, from the geometrical limitations imposed by the \lhcb detector 
% acceptance, to the selection cuts.
% Combined with a measurement of the collected integrated luminosity \intlumi and 
% the branching fraction \bfrac of the decay mode $f$ in question, the cross 
% section for a single charm hadron \Hc in a given \pTy bin $i$ can be computed 
% as
% \begin{equation}
%   \sigma_{i}(\Hc) =
%   \frac{N_{i}(\HcTof)}{\eff_{i}(\HcTof)\cdot\bfrac(\HcTof)\cdot\intlumi}.
% 	\label{eqn:intro:binned_xsec}
% \end{equation}
% Double differential cross sections can then be determined using the width of 
% the bin in \pT, $\Delta\pT$, and the width of the bin in rapidity, 
% $\Delta\rapidity$, in which the yield and efficiency measurements were made
% \begin{equation}
%   % There is a "\left." here, which is invisible, to balance the "\right\rvert"
%   \left.\frac{\text{d}^{2}\sigma(\Hc)}{\text{d}\pT\text{d}\rapidity}\right\rvert_{i}
%     = \frac{\sigma_{i}(\Hc)}{\Delta\pT\Delta\rapidity}.
% \end{equation}
% Throughout this note, bin boundaries are given using the ISO 31-11 standard, 
% where, for example, the half-open interval $a \leq x < b$ is denoted $[a, 
%   b[$~\cite{ISO3111}.

% We intend to measure the absolute cross sections of \Dz, \Dp, \Dsp, and \Dsp 
% hadrons in bins of width \SI{1}{\GeV} in transverse momentum, for $\pT \in [0, 
%   8[\si{\GeV}$, and in bins of width $0.5$ in rapidity, for $\rapidity \in
%     [2.0, 4.5[$.

% In addition, we intend to measure the \comenergy cross-sections relative 
% between modes, such as $\sigma(\Dz)/\sigma(\Dp)$, and relative between bins, 
% where every measurement is normalised to a single `central' bin.
% The motivation for making these additional measurements also comes from the 
% theory community.

% \subsection{Propagation of uncertainties}
% \label{sec:intro:uncertainties}

% When computing the uncertainty on a function $f(a)$, the assumptions of linear 
% error propagation may not hold.
% In this analysis, the uncertainties on the quantities in the denominator of 
% Equation~\ref{eqn:intro:binned_xsec} can be large in some \pTy bins, thereby 
% making a linear approximation of $\sigma_{i}$ insufficient.

% Instead of using this analytical approach, we instead use a Monte Carlo error 
% propagation technique.
% With this, a large set of numbers $S$ is sampled from a chosen model $M$, and 
% operations are performed directly on the ensemble by mapping the operation on 
% to the elements on $S$.
% Statistics such as the mean and standard deviation can then be computed on the 
% resulting set.

% Unless stated otherwise, each quantity to which an uncertainty is assigned is 
% modelled as a normal distribution, $N(\mu, \sigma)$, whose mean $\mu$ is the 
% value found by the appropriate procedure, and whose standard deviation $\sigma$ 
% is taken as the uncertainty on that value.
% In the case of the prompt signal yield, for example, the mean of the normal 
% distribution will be the fitted value, and the width will be the uncertainty 
% returned by the fitter.
% We generate ten thousand numbers from each model $M$ per ensemble. An illustration
% for the obtained posterior distributions is given in Figure~\ref{fig:int:posterior}.

%     \DsTophipi measurement, illustrating the asymmetric distribution due to large
%     uncertainties in the denominator.

% Having outlined the general analysis, Section~\ref{sec:theory} shall describe 
% the theoretical models available for comparison with the data.
% The data itself will then be discussed in Section~\ref{sec:data}, including 
% details on the running conditions of the \lhc, the trigger strategy, and which 
% simulated samples are used.
% The selection applied to the candidates will follow in Section~\ref{sec:sel}, 
% including a brief description of how the charm hadron candidates are 
% reconstructed.
% In Section~\ref{sec:effs} the efficiencies of each reconstruction and selection 
% stage will be described and given, and the fitting framework that counts the 
% yields of the various signal and background components after the full selection 
% will be shown in Section~\ref{sec:fitting}.
% The sources of systematic uncertainty in the analysis will be enumerated and 
% evaluated in Section~\ref{sec:syst}.
% Finally, the results of the measurement will be given in 
% Section~\ref{sec:results}.
