\chapter{Theory and motivation}
\label{chap:prod:theory}

Hadrons contain quarks, and these are bound together through gluon exchange.
As well as the `sea' of gluons binding the constituent quarks of the hadron 
together, virtual \qqbar\ pairs can be created as the gluons propagate, quickly 
annihilating internally to the hadrons.
In high-energy interactions, it is these \emph{partons} that interact, the 
quarks and gluons, rather than the composite hadrons.
Their behaviour then must be understood in order to predict production rates at 
hadron colliders.
This \namecref{chap:prod:theory} shall begin by describing how hadron 
production rates can be computed using theoretical and experimental inputs, and 
shall then give an example of how the results are used outside of collider 
physics.

\section{Parton density functions}
\label{chap:prod:theory:pdfs}

For an observable cross-section \xsec\ of inclusive production of some object 
$P$, $\decay{h_{A}h_{B}}{PX}$, involving two initial-state hadrons $h_{A}$ and 
$h_{B}$, the dominant contribution to a prediction can be expressed as the 
convolution of several terms
\begin{equation}
  \xsec = \sum_{a,b} \sigma_{a,b} \otimes f_{a,A} \otimes f_{b,B},
  \label{eqn:prod:theory:factorisation}
\end{equation}
where the sum runs over all parton types $a$ and $b$ in the respective hadrons 
$h_{A}$ and $h_{B}$; $\sigma_{a,b}$ is the cross-section of the hard 
interaction $\decay{ab}{PX}$; and $f$ is the \ac{QCDPDF} for the interacting 
parton in the respective hadron~\cite{Collins:1989gx,Forte:2013wc}.
The parton-parton cross-sections, for processes such as heavy quark pair 
production via gluon-gluon fusion shown in 
\cref{fig:intro:lhcb:hf_production:gg_fusion}, can be computed using 
perturbative \ac{QCD}.
The computations of the \acp{QCDPDF} involve low energy processes below the 
\ac{QCD} scale, and so must be evaluated using non-perturbative \ac{QCD} 
instead, which is intractable with today's theoretical understanding.
Clearly, the computation of any cross-section at the \ac{LHC} relies on being 
able to evaluate \cref{eqn:prod:theory:factorisation}, including the 
computation of production rates of the Higgs boson and particles beyond the 
\ac{SM}, and hence on a knowledge of the \acp{QCDPDF}.
Instead of being computed from first principles, they can be constrained using 
measurements of cross-sections by experiments.
Additional measurements of cross-sections can constrain the \acp{QCDPDF} 
further, improving their precision, and hence there is always motivation for 
making such measurements, until the theoretical understanding improves 
sufficiently.

Parton density functions are parameterised by \bjorkenx, the fraction of the 
total hadron momentum carried by the interacting parton, and \pdfqsquared, a 
measure of momentum transfer and inversely proportional to the spatial `scale' 
at which the hadron can be probed, with a larger \pdfqsquared\ corresponding to 
a finer resolvable structure.
The \ac{QCDPDF} $f(\bjorkenx, \pdfqsquared)$ for a particular hadron is an 
intrinsic property, and so, for example, experimental measurements that can 
constrain the \ac{QCDPDF} in high-energy proton collisions help not only the 
experiments at that collider, but also experiments at other proton colliders.
This is possible, despite \pdfqsquared\ generally being different between 
colliders, as the evolution of the \acp{QCDPDF} over \pdfqsquared\ for a given 
value of \bjorkenx\ is described by the \ac{DGLAP} differential 
equations~\cite{Gribov:1972ri,Dokshitzer:1977sg,Altarelli:1977zs}.
Measuring a wide range of \bjorkenx\ is important as the individual 
contributions to the total \ac{QCDPDF}, such as from the gluons and the valance 
quarks, vary strongly as a function of \bjorkenx, as shown in 
\cref{fig:prod:theory:pdf_sets}.
The usage of the \ac{DGLAP} equations requires an initial \ac{QCDPDF} from 
which to evolve to different scales, however, as the dependence on \bjorkenx\ 
cannot be computed perturbatively.
Such inputs were first provided by \ac{DIS} experiments, which probe the proton 
structure by colliding leptons and protons and measuring the angle of the 
deflection of the lepton due to its interactions with the partons.

The treatment of experimental inputs is a matter of debate, as there are 
somewhat arbitrary choices to be made on \emph{what} experimental inputs should 
be used, and on how the various experimental uncertainties should be 
treated.
As a result, different groups of theorists provide so-called `\ac{QCDPDF} 
sets', which differ not only in the treatment of the inputs, but also in the 
treatment of the \emph{theoretical} uncertainties.
These include, for example, the choice of order to which the perturbation 
series are evaluated, and whether the value of the perturbation series scale is 
a parameter of the fit or if it is fixed.
For heavy flavour production, additional uncertainties arise from the choice of 
\emph{fragmentation function} models~\cite{Kneesch:2007ey}, which describe how 
the heavy quarks transition into the observed hadrons, a factor which is not 
included in the factorisation theorem shown in 
\cref{eqn:prod:theory:factorisation}.\footnotemark
The different \ac{QCDPDF} sets can be used to compute different cross-section 
predictions, and so further experimental measurements can help to distinguish 
between predictions, indicating which ones describe the true \acp{QCDPDF}.

\footnotetext{%
  The fragmentation functions are generally assumed to be process independent, 
  e.g.\ they are the same for heavy flavour hadron production from \qqbar\ 
  production at both $\Pelectron\APelectron$ and $\Pproton\Pproton$ colliders.
  They cannot be computed perturbatively, and are extracted from experimental 
  measurements like the \acp{QCDPDF} are.

\subsection{Experimental input}
\label{chap:prod:theory:pdfs:inputs}

Today, inputs from both \ac{DIS} and hadron-hadron collider experiments serve 
to constrain proton \acp{QCDPDF} over a wide range of \bjorkenx\ and 
\pdfqsquared\ values.
The most recent and most powerful \ac{DIS} measurements have been made by the 
\hone\ and \zeus\ collaborations at the \hera\ $\Pe\Pproton$ 
collider~\cite{Abramowicz:1900rp}.
However, these measurements are largely constrained to measure values of 
\bjorkenx\ above \num{e-4}, leading to large uncertainties at values of low 
\bjorkenx.
This low-\bjorkenx\ region is particularly interesting to study not only 
because the current \ac{QCDPDF} uncertainties there are large, due to the lack 
of experimental input, but also because it is where both the gluon and the sea 
quark contributions to the total \ac{QCDPDF} are large, as shown in 
\cref{fig:prod:theory:pdf_sets}, and so low-\bjorkenx\ measurements probe 
phenomenologically different processes.

In a hard \decay{2}{2} process, such a $\Pgluon\Pgluon$ fusion or \qqbar\ 
annihilation to a heavy quark pair, the minimum \bjorkenx\ that can be reached 
with heavy flavour hadron production measurements is given by
\begin{equation}
  {\bjorkenx}_{\text{min}} = e^{\pm\rapidity}\frac{%
    \sqrt{\pT^{2} + m_{\Pquark}^{2}}
  }{%
    \sqrts
  },
  \label{fig:prod:theory:hf_bjorkenx}
\end{equation}
where \rapidity\ and \pT\ parameterise the hadron kinematics, and $m_{q}$ is 
the mass of the heavy quark in the hadron under study~\cite{Zenaiev:2015rfa}.
There is then a wide range of \bjorkenx\ values that can be probed at proton 
colliders, with the highest sensitivity to low \bjorkenx\ provided by charm 
production measurements.\footnotemark
At the \ac{LHC}, the dominant production mechanism is gluon-gluon fusion, as 
depicted in \cref{fig:intro:lhcb:hf_production:gg_fusion}, and so measurements 
at the \ac{LHC} are able to provide particularly strong constraints on the 
gluon densities.
Charm cross-sections have been measured in the $|\rapidity| < 0.5$ region for 
$\pT > \SI{1}{\GeVc}$ at \sqrtseq{2.76}\ and \sqrtseq{7}\ by the \alice\ 
collaboration~\cite{Abelev:2012sx,ALICE:2012ik,ALICE:2011aa},
and for pseudorapidity $|\Eta| < 2.1$ in the \pT\ region $3.5 < \pT < 
\SI{100}{\GeVc}$ at \sqrtseq{7} by the \atlas\ 
collaboration~\cite{Aad:2015zix}.

\footnotetext{%
  The charm quark mass is four times lighter than that of the bottom quark.
}

Measurements of charm production at \sqrtseq{7}\ were made by the \lhcb\ 
collaboration~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2012-041}.
By \cref{fig:prod:theory:hf_bjorkenx}, measurements of charm hadron production 
for \pT\ values of the order of \SI{1}{\GeVc} at the lowest rapidities 
accessible to \lhcb\ can probe \bjorkenx\ values down to the order of \SI{e-6}, 
with lower values possible for measurements at a higher \sqrts, as shown in 
\cref{fig:prod:theory:prosa_x_regions}.
These measurements, along with similar measurements of beauty hadron production 
at \lhcb~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2013-004} and the aforementioned \hone\ and \zeus\ 
measurements, have been used by the \prosa\ 
collaboration~\cite{Zenaiev:2015rfa} to constrain the proton \aclp{QCDPDF}, 
where they see a significant reduction on the gluon \ac{QCDPDF} uncertainty 
when including the \lhcb\ data, with respect to using the \hera\ data only, as 
shown in \cref{fig:prod:theory:prosa_gluon_pdf_fit}.
It is expected that additional measurements, at \sqrtseq{13}, can be used to 
further reduce the gluon \ac{QCDPDF} uncertainties~\cite{Gauld:2015yia}.

\section{Atmospheric neutrino fluxes}
\label{chap:prod:theory:neutrinos}

In addition to the prominent use cases for predictions of hadron 
cross-sections, those at hadron colliders, the constraints imposed on the 
proton \acp{QCDPDF} are also useful in atmospheric neutrino experiments.
The \icecube\ collaboration aims to measure highly energetic neutrinos of 
astrophysical origin with energies up to the \si{\peta\eV} scale, using the 
IceCube Neutrino Observatory~\cite{Achterberg:2006md}.
This is done to shed light on the mystery of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays 
(protons) whose source is unknown but should also produce similarly energetic
neutrinos.

The principle neutrino detection mechanism used in the \icecube\ detector is 
illustrated in \cref{fig:prod:theory:icecube:signal}.
A cubic kilometre of ice is instrumented with a set of \num{4800} 
photo-detectors, which detect light produced during neutrino interactions.
The light is produced via high-energy neutrinos interacting with the protons 
and neutrons of the ice, creating high-energy charged leptons which then travel 
through the ice and emit Cherenkov radiation, in an identical manner to that 
described in \cref{chap:intro:lhcb:detector}.
The photo-detectors are spatially arranged as an array, which can be used to 
measure the intensity of the light, proportional to the charged lepton energy 
and hence to the neutrino energy, as well as its direction, which can be used 
to identify point-like sources for further astronomical observation.

The so-called conventional neutrino flux constitutes one of the backgrounds for 
astrophysical neutrino experiments.
This is made by cosmic rays interacting in the atmosphere and producing pions 
and kaons, which then decay to final states containing neutrinos.
However, for the high energies the \icecube\ detector is sensitive to, 
beginning at around \SI{100}{\GeV}, this background is suppressed.
The long lifetime of the mesons increases the probability they will interact 
with the atmosphere in flight, losing energy through hadronic interactions, 
hence reducing the energy spectrum of the resulting neutrinos.
However, an additional background comes from the production of charm hadrons in 
the atmosphere, which, with their comparatively short lifetimes, lose very 
little energy in flight, and so the neutrino spectrum from charm decays is very 
similar to the cosmic ray energy spectrum.
The neutrinos produced in the charm decays can interact with the detector in a 
similar manner to the signal, as shown in 
\cref{fig:prod:theory:icecube:background}, and exhibit a similar energy 
spectrum, as shown in \cref{fig:prod:theory:icecube_energy}.
It is then of key importance that the amount of expected background from these 
decays is known, else neutrinos from charm decays may be misinterpreted as 
neutrinos from astrophysical sources.
This contamination can be estimated by predicting the proton-proton 
cross-sections (between the cosmic ray and the nuclei in the atmosphere), which 
is an identical problem to that in \cref{eqn:prod:theory:factorisation}.

Colliding equal-energy proton-proton beams at a centre-of-mass energy of 
\SI{13}{\TeV} is equivalent to directing a proton beam of energy 
\SI{100}{\peta\eV} into a fixed target, as $\sqrts \approx 
\sqrt{2E_{\Pproton}m_{\Pproton}}$, where $E_{\Pproton}$ is the energy of the 
proton beam and $m_{\Pproton}$ is the proton mass.
Hence, measuring charm cross-sections at \sqrtseq{13}\ at the \ac{LHC} can 
provide constraints on the expected rate of charm production in the atmosphere 
produced by extremely high-energy cosmic rays.
Indeed, the measurements made by \lhcb\ at \sqrtseq{7}\ have already been used 
to that effect, and additional measurements at \SI{13}{\TeV} can help 
further~\cite{Gauld:2015yia,Bhattacharya:2015jpa}.

\section{Cross-section comparisons with theory}
\label{chap:prod:theory:comparisons}

A useful check of \acp{QCDPDF} constrained with past experimental data is to 
compute cross-section predictions using them, for comparison with new 
experimental results.
This was done in the previous \lhcb\ open charm cross-section analysis, shown 
in \cref{fig:prod:theory:comparisons:7tev}, where at low \pT\ the data 
generally lie above the theory prediction.
Additional measurements can help in the understanding of these discrepancies.

For the analysis under discussion, a measurement of charm production at 
\sqrtseq{13}, three theory groups have provided predictions for the double 
differential cross-sections, as defined by 
\cref{eqn:prod:introduction:cross_section}.
Each set of predictions is computed at next-to-leading order in the 
perturbative \ac{QCD} parameter \alphas\ (that is, up to the first power of 
$\alphas$), and includes uncertainties from: the \emph{factorisation scale} 
dependence, which is the scale \pdfqsquared\ at which the perturbative 
expansion was made; and the \emph{renormalisation scale}, which is the scale at 
which the expansion is renormalised to eliminate ultraviolet divergences.
These affect both the evaluation of the partonic cross-sections and of the 
evolution of the \ac{QCDPDF} sets with the \ac{DGLAP} equations.

The \nnpdfl\ predictions~\cite{Gauld:2015yia} use a \ac{QCDPDF} set that 
includes the constraints from the \sqrtseq{7}\ \lhcb\ 
measurement~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2012-041}, and are provided for all \pTy\ bins for 
\PDz and \PDp mesons.
The \ac{GMVFNS} predictions~\cite{Kniehl:2012ti} are provided for $\pT > 
\SI{3}{\GeVc}$ for all mesons under study, and use the CT10 \ac{QCDPDF} set.
These predictions include a factor to account for the \cToHc\ transition 
probability, by convolving the \decay{\ccbar}{\PHc} cross-sections with the 
appropriate fragmentation functions.
Finally, \ac{FONLL} predicitions~\cite{Cacciari:2015fta} using the \nnpdf\ 
\ac{QCDPDF} sets are provided for for the full \pTy phase space for \PDz, \PDp, 
and \PDstarp mesons.
The \fonll\ predictions assume a unit \cToHc\ transition probability, and so 
are multiplied by the fragmentation fractions in 
\cref{tab:prod:introduction:fragmentation_fractions} for comparison with the 
measurements.

The comparison of these predictions with the data shall be given in 
\cref{chap:prod:results}.
