Scripts
=======

This is a very disgusting collection of scripts used to make plots for the 
thesis which either didn't appear in the corresponding analysis notes and 
papers, or did appear but not in a style that's consistent with the rest of 
thesis.

These scripts do not represent the pinnacle of Python programming zen.
They were hacked together as quickly as possible such that the plots I needed 
were made, with files copied in from other projects when I needed something 
done that I did before somewhere else.
